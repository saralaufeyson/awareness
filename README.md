# Pet Protection Awareness Website

Welcome to our Pet Protection Awareness project! This website is a heartfelt initiative to spread awareness about the welfare of pets and stray dogs. Our mission is to educate and inspire action through three interactive pages:

1. **Home Page**: Discover our cause and understand the importance of pet protection.
2. **Learn More**: Dive into the issues facing pets and strays, and see how you can help.
3. **Get Involved**: Engage with our interactive buttons to take action and make a difference.

Together, we can create a safer world for our furry friends. Let's start making an impact today!
